# PopuLert AI Chat Advisor

PopuLert is an application designed to evaluate occupancy levels in establishments, optimizing personal schedules and reducing wasted time. Allen Thomas and I developed an AI Chat Advisor for the application. This advisor generates schedules and gives recommendations based on user interests and crowd levels at different locations. This was developed primarily with React.js and OpenAI API. We are planning to make continuous changes to this chatbot based on user feedback, assuming we continue developing the PopuLert platform. For instance, we are planning to implement pre-determined fields to decrease the number of hallucinations by the chatbot to little or none.
